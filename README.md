Guide

1. <b id="installation-install-python">Install Python: </b> To run the project, ensure Python is installed on your machine. Although Python comes pre-installed on many Linux distributions, the version may vary depending on the distribution and operating system version. If Python is not installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. <b id="installation-confirm-installation-python"> Confirm Python installation: </b> To confirm the successful installation of Python, run the following command in your command line interface (CMD/Terminal...). 

```
python3 --version
```

Please note the potential variations in the command based on how Python was installed on your system: some commands may begin with `python`, others with `python3`, and yet others with `py`. Despite the differences in reference, they all refer to the same command.

3. <b id="installation-install-postgres"> Install postgres: </b> Download the installer from the [PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org) and follow the installation instructions

4. <b id="installation-confirm-installation-postgres"> Confirm PostgreSQL installation: </b> To validate the successful installation of PostgreSQL, execute the subsequent command within your command line interface (CLI), whether it's CMD or Terminal.

```
postgres --version
```

5. <b id="installation-clone-project">Clone the project:</b> Navigate to your preferred installation directory using your command-line interface, and proceed to clone the project. If you encounter any difficulties, you can find more information about cloning your project [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
